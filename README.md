## Tasks

Instead of `grunt`, this template uses `npm` as a task runner. This is more
conventional for modern Express apps, and it's handy because we'll definitely
use `npm` anyway. These are the commands available:

| Command                | Effect                                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run server`       | Starts a development server with `nodemon` that automatically refreshes when you change something.                                                                                         |
| `npm test`             | Runs automated tests.                                                                                       |
| `npm run debug-server` | Starts the server in debug mode, which will print lots of extra info about what's happening inside the app. |
